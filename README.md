A review study published this month in Perspectives in Psychological Science found that loneliness was predictive of death, particularly for people under the age of 65. In a study of 1,000 women 15 years of age or older, 36% had experienced emotional abuse while growing up; 43% had experienced some form of abuse as children or adolescents About 80% of 21 year olds that were abused as children met criteria for at least one psychological disorder. About 30% of abused and neglected children will later abuse their own children, continuing the horrible cycle of abuse. Also, more than one out of every five (20.8%) students report being bullied (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2016). 64% of children who were bullied did not report it. Most of time they do not want to disclose those issues because of ‘hesitation and obloquy’. But this is the point of time when we need mental and emotional supports most. This is where our app “Best Friend” will solve the problem. Best Friend is someone whom we can trust and someone in whom we confide or talk anything like writing a secret diary and take feedback. By maintaining this definition our app “Best Friend” is a platform where anyone can share his or her incidents ANONYMOUSLY. After that not only his or her story will be recorded for further action and data research but also he or she will get mental and emotional support anonymously from the community. Also professional psychiatrist will give their feedback regarding the problems of the victim. Our main target is giving everyone a platform where “hesitation” won’t be a barrier for getting help. most of the time the women & children are neglected to raise their voice. We can see, if a woman or a child have been beaten or abused physically. We never ever notice how much bleeding carrying out by him or her to mature one who is passing the emotional abuse. Their continuous pains that only can be heal by humanity and emotions and give him/her a support. If someone is beaten he can take a painkiller and heal the pain, but here the situation is worst. So we have decided give them an app named “BestFriend". So that they can share their emotional abuse and anonymously. People can interact within the post, give that person support and also inform civil defense if that goes beyond tolerance.
